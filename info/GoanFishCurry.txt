# Intro
Goa’s cuisine stands out from the rest of the country as its diverse history has created a unique blend of flavours and influences. 
The Portuguese occupation and the influx of Saraswat Brahmins from further north coincided to create a truly special set of dishes 
and one of the most famous – and beloved – among them is the simple Goan Fish Curry, known as Xitti Kodi in the local language Konkani.  

This curry typically consists of firm white fish cooked in a tangy and aromatic sauce enriched with coconut milk,
spices, and fresh herbs. It's a simple culinary journey to the beautiful beaches of Goa without the need for extra frills or flounces.
Eaten in most homes as a quick dinner or as part of a larger seafood thali, it's much loved at any time of the year.


# History Of Goan Rice And Fish Curry

The history of Goan Fish Curry reflects the influence of Portuguese colonialism and the abundant seafood along the coastline.
This fusion of Indian and Portuguese flavours brought forth a unique culinary style featuring spices like turmeric, coriander, and chilli.
Goan Fish Curry stands as a testament to this cultural blend, becoming an integral part of Goan identity.
It embodies the rich history and traditions that have shaped Goan culture over the centuries.

Saraswat Brahmins, the earliest settlers in Goa around 600 BC, initially established themselves in the bordering talukas in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
They sought refuge due to religious persecution, first under the Sultanate and later under Portuguese rule, leading them to live quietly and inconspicuously.
Consequently, the authenticity of their cuisine has remained intact.

While their culinary traditions in Goa evolved over centuries, influenced by Muslim and Christian elements,
the original essence persisted, quietly preserved. Over time, Hooman transformed into what we now know as Kodhi or Goan fish curry. 
Saraswat Brahmins use lime and tamarind pulp for souring, in contrast to the toddy vinegar and kokum favoured in Christian households,
which were introduced later. Similarly, Xacutti, a distinctive Goan preparation today, has its roots in shagoti, another Saraswat dish that contributed to the region's culinary heritage.


Types Of Goan Fish Curry

Xitti Kodi: Goan fish curry, known as Xitti Kodi, is a popular Goan staple. This dish is rich in spices and coconut, with a tangy twist from raw mango. It typically features Pomfret or Kingfish and is served with rice.

Dried Mackerel Curry: During the summer season, Goans prepare dry fish curries using stockpiled dried fish. These satisfying curries are a monsoon season favourite and are traditionally served with rice.

Mackerel Curry (Bangdyache Hooman): This mackerel curry pairs wonderfully with Goan rice or ukde tandul. It is built around the flavours of tefal berries, Sichuan peppercorns, green chillies, ginger, and red chillies for a spiced melange of flavours. Tamarind or kokum add a delightful tanginess to this spicy and tangy dish.

Ambot Tik: Influenced by Portuguese cuisine, Ambot Tik combines "ambot" (sour) and "tik" (spicy). It features shark fish cooked with Kashmiri red chillies for heat and Kokum for a sour kick, alongside onions, tomatoes, and masala.

Caldin Curry: This milder version of the typical fish curry is made with more coconut milk and less chillies for a soft, yellow curry that is perfectly paired with Goan red rice.
