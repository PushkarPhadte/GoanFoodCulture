            <h2>The History of Goan Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                Goan cuisine is the result of centuries of cultural exchange‚Äîshaped by ancient Saraswat Brahmin settlers, rich coastal bounty, and 450 years of Portuguese influence. From fiery Xacuti curries to coconut-laden seafood stews and decadent sweets, Goan food is a testament to resilience, diversity, and the spirit of celebration. Today, every Goan kitchen tells the story of its past: local spices, fresh seafood, and European techniques combined in unique harmony.
